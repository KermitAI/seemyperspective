        <p>These are multi-purpose apps with many features, with the potential to almost rival other Discord apps, such as Dyno, Sapphire, and Carl; however, unlike those, both Paimon and The Assistant are not capable of mass server usage, in terms of being used in over 100 different servers.</p>
        <p>Both apps require to be set up manually in each new server they join. I, as the apps manager, require access to configure them and maintain them, fixing any issues that may arise to being available immediately for questions or queries.</p>

            <h3>BanCheck and BanSync</h3>
            <p>If enabled, each new user who joins your Discord is checked against a largely gathered database of Discord Bad Actors. This means anyone flagged for sending unsolicited content, harassment of any kind, or even Discord TOS violations will be listed. Additionally, for BanSync, if enabled, your server will join a list of connected servers for autobans. This means if a bad actor is banned in one server, all connected servers will automatically ban the bad actor.</p>

        <h2>Want to contribute to the project?</h2>
        <p>I pride in the fact that no features that are critical or common is locked behind paywalls (unlike other apps that lock 90% of their moderation modules), however they do still cost money for the server host with DDoS protection, 32GB Ram and Unlimited Bandwidth.</p>
        <p>If you want to contribute, please be aware that it is not required for Server Owners using the apps or members who enjoy them, to put money towards them. However, I do understand wanting to help out and invest in something you enjoy. For Terms and Conditions on the subject of donations, please see the <a href="#">Legal Info</a> page. Hosting costs: $64.</p>
        <p>To donate to the project, there are two options, of which are listed below:</p>
        <p>Paypal<br><a href="#">Ko-Fi</a></p>
        <p>For those who donate, your name of choice (screen name or actual name, within reason of course) will be added to the `supporters` command, which is a global command and viewable in all servers either app is a part of.</p>
